## ⚙️ Setup

### 🐳 Inside Codex Container

> 🛑 `dotnet` and `postgresql` are **not included by default** in the container.
> You must run the following scripts after cloning:

```bash
./scripts/install_dotnet.sh
./scripts/install_and_mount_pg.sh
````

* `install_dotnet.sh`: installs the required .NET SDK (8.x)
* `install_and_mount_pg.sh`: installs PostgreSQL and mounts persistent data to `./pgdata`

Make sure the PostgreSQL service is up before running the app.

## 🛠 Development Workflow

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone <this-repo>
   cd <this-repo>
   ```

2. Start your Codex container:

   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it \
     -e CODEX_ENV_DOTNET_VERSION=8.0.2 \
     -v "${PWD}:/workspace/$(basename $PWD)" \
     -w "/workspace/$(basename $PWD)" \
     ghcr.io/openai/codex-universal:latest
   ```

3. Inside the container:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/install_dotnet.sh
   ./scripts/install_and_mount_pg.sh
   ```

4. Run the backend and frontend:

   ```bash
   # in one terminal
   dotnet run --project backend

   # in another terminal
   dotnet run --project frontend
   ```

   The backend listens on port `5000` by default and provides the API used by the Blazor app.

   On first launch the backend seeds a small amount of sample data so the UI has something to display.
